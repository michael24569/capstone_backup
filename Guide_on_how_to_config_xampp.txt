Using XAMPP Control Panel's Auto Start:


Open XAMPP Control Panel as the Administrator
Click on "Config" button (top right)
Select "Service and Port Settings"
Check the boxes for "Autostart Module" for both Apache and MySQL
Click "Save"
Restart XAMPP


Using Windows Services (more reliable):


Open XAMPP Control Panel as the Administrator
Click on "Apache" service → Click "Service" button
Do the same for MySQL service
This installs them as Windows services
Open Windows Services (services.msc) or simply press windows + R then search services.msc
Find "Apache2.4" and "MySQL" services
Right-click each → Properties
Change "Startup type" to "Automatic"
Click "Apply" and "OK"
